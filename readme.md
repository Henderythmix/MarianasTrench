Similar to [The Oregon Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(1985_video_game)), the goal of this game is to dive and reach the bottom of the ocean as a startup organization with a submarine that can travel at 1m/s, hold 100L of oxygen, and the deepest it can reach is 1000m. This game was made in a week for Brackeys Jam 2023.2
