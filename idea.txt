Similar to the “Oregon Trail”-esque games we thought of, we can make one like this.
you are a researcher going deeper to explore underwater in a submarine. 
The deeper you go, the less stable your experience is, so you need to return to the surface to upgrade your submarine so you can go deeper.
You will encounter random events that can hinder, or improve your experience.
You are rewarded money based on the “research” you discover, and how deep you can go.
